# EduFi Mock Backend

## Description

As of 29 January 2022, I was having difficulties to consume other microservices, hence I decided to create a mock database mock server to satisfy the necessary requirements and for demo purposes.

### Module Microservice

As of 29 January 2022, no one had implemented an endpoint which retrieves the modules taken by a student.

### Mark Microservice

As of 29 January 2022, I was having difficulty to consume http://10.31.11.12:9201/api/v1/marks/1 to retrieve marks by a specific student. It returns plain text for the result.

### Timetable Microservice

As of 29 January 2022, the developer of Timetable REST API had not updated his endpoint url to the exact port used in the server, hence I was not able to consume the microservice. Besides, I tried to run his code locally but the API returned html object instead of array of json object.

### Rating Microservice

As of 5 February 2022, the developer of Rating REST API didnt upload any documentation for the usage, although I find his code in Github (not completely done yet).

### Comment Microservice

As of 5 February 2022, the developer of Comment REST API didnt upload any documentation for the usage, although I find his code in Github (not completely done yet).

### Tutor Microservice

As of 5 February 2022, the developer of Tutor REST API didnt upload any documentation for the usage, although I find his code in Github.
